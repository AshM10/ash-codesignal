/*
In the popular Minesweeper game you have a board with 
some mines and those cells that don't contain a mine have
 a number in it that indicates the total number of mines 
 in the neighboring cells. Starting off with some arrangement
  of mines we want to create a Minesweeper game setup.
Example
For
matrix = [[true, false, false],
          [false, true, false],
          [false, false, false]]
the output should be
minesweeper(matrix) = [[1, 2, 1],
                       [2, 1, 1],
                       [1, 1, 1]]

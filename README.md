# ash-codesignal: algorithm practice

- This repository is solely created for my JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms problem solving via Code Signal. Repository kind of started really late because I've done a few problems on the Arcade already before deciding to document my practice in Github. This repository will constantly be updated as I go through the challenge.
